# Quality_check
•	The main aim of this project to classify whether images contain either a defective or good product.
•	Defects are unwanted thing in casting industry. For removing this defective product all industry have their quality inspection department. But main problem is this inspection process is carried out manually. It is very time consuming process and due to human accuracy this is not 100% accurate.
•	We decided to make inspection process automatic and for this we need to make deep learning classification model for this problem.
